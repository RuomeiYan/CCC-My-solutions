# This solution is by Jacob Jackson of University of Toronto Schools
#
# This is Jackson's explaination of the code:
#
# Make a list of all points and add the origin to that list.
# Take all pairs of points and sort them in increasing order of distance.
# Process these pairs in order, keeping an array best[N],
# which represents the maximum number of treats attainable
# from a given location if you can't travel farther than the current distance
# (the current distance = the distance between the two points
# you're currently processing).
# For each pair (A, B), consider traveling from A to B or from B to A. That is,
#     best[A] = max(best[A], best[B] + 1);
#     best[B] = max(best[B], best[A] + 1);
#
# Here is a trace of the variables as it processes the example data set
# given with the problem statement:
#
#   pairs [[1, 3, 4], [1, 4, 5], [4, 3, 5], [5, 1, 2], [10, 0, 3],
#          [13, 0, 4], [18, 0, 5], [29, 1, 5], [40, 1, 4], [50, 2, 5],
#          [53, 1, 3], [65, 2, 4], [82, 2, 3], [89, 0, 1], [116, 0, 2]]
#
#   pair= [1, 3, 4]
#   pdist= [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]   pbest= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]   best= [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

# Times of the test data sets on my Pentium 4, 3.2Ghz processor.
#     1 to 9 all well less than 1 sec
#     10 = 5.5 sec
#     11 = 25 sec
#     12 = 16 sec
#     13 = 20 sec
#     14 = 20 sec
#     15 = 26 sec
# Several other people sent me solutions, but
# NONE were as fast as this. Not even close. So if you think you can
# do better, run this on your machine as a benchmark and
# write a faster PYTHON program. And no fair using anything
# built-in other than sort() and normal array processing. :-)
